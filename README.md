# Decision Tree Projects Repository

Welcome to the Decision Tree Projects repository, featuring three distinct projects showcasing the application of Decision Tree models in various tasks: California Housing Price Prediction, Iris Flower Classification, and a General Decision Tree Classifier. Each project is encapsulated in its respective Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and understanding.

## 1. California Housing Price Prediction

### Overview

The California Housing Price Prediction project aims to predict the median house value for California districts using a Decision Tree Regressor.

### Dataset

The dataset comprises 20,640 instances with 8 attributes such as median income, house age, and latitude.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandraparsad3/DecisionTree.git
   cd DecisionTree
   ```

2. **Open and run the `california_housing.ipynb` notebook.**

### Results

The Decision Tree Regressor achieves an R2 score of 0.59 on the test set.

## 2. Iris Flower Classification

### Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project involves classifying Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica) using a Decision Tree Classifier.

### Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 instances with four numeric attributes and three target classes.

### Usage

1. **Open and run the `iris_classification.ipynb` notebook.**

### Results

The Decision Tree Classifier achieves an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

## 3. General Decision Tree Classifier

### Overview

This project provides a general template for a Decision Tree Classifier. It covers topics such as visualization, pre-pruning, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Usage

1. **Open and run the `decision_tree_classifier.ipynb` notebook.**

### Results

The project demonstrates the Decision Tree Classifier's application with visualizations, pre-pruning, and hyperparameter tuning, achieving an accuracy of 92% on the test set.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the required Python libraries are installed:
